# Flask-RegEx-and-Email-Verification-WebApp

This flask web application allows users to perform two tasks:

1. **RegEx Matching**: Users can input a regular expression and a string. The application then uses Python's `re` module to find all matches of the regular expression within the string.

2. **Email Verification**: Users can input an email address, and the application validates whether the email address is in a valid format.
