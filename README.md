# Flask-RegEx-and-Email-Verification-WebApp

This application is built mainly using Flask Framework in python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This flask web application allows users to perform two tasks:

1. **RegEx Matching**: Users can input a regular expression and a string. The application then uses Python's `re` module to find all matches of the regular expression within the string.

2. **Email Verification**: Users can input an email address, and the application validates whether the email address is in a valid format.

* The application is deployed on AWS EC2 and can be accessed at http://54.166.164.52:5000/. (NOTE : EC2 Deployment is Inactive as Free Credits are depleted)
* On the home page, you can use the RegEx Matching form to input a regular expression and a string. Click on "Get answer" to see the matches.
* Additionally, you can use the Email Verification form to input an email address and verify its validity.
